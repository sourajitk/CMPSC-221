# Scrabble!
This is a Scrabble game that allows two players to play against each other. The game uses backend logic written in Java and frontend GUI in Swing.

# Features

- Inbuilt word checker using [RapidAPI's WordsAPI.](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi/details)

# Contributions

Note: To run this program you will have to create a file named `WordsAPIKey.java` with the following syntax:
```bash
public class WordsAPIKey {
    public static final String API_KEY = "your_key";
}
```
RapidAPI keys are usually free up to 2,500 requests so retrieving one shouldn't be a hassle.
